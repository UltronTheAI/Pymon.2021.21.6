# Pymon.2021.21.6
    Hi there,

    Pymon is like nodemon but it is for python, 

    why i create pymon ==> we have to click run button or python command many time`s to run python code, so to solve this i create pymon, we have to run this command only one time and i will re-run automatically, to stop pymon press in cmd CTR + C.

    Thank`s.
  
# Run Python Code With Pymon
